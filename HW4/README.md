# PUI2015_cdavis
# Week 4 Homework


This folder contains the homework for week 3 of PUI.  It consists of 3 seperate ipython notebooks.

Since I am running my notebooks in Python 3, it might be useful to have the following imports to run the notebooks:

#to run the python3 style print statements

from __future__ import print_function

#to download the data from a zip file on a website I use the package io but a Python 2 user would use StringIO, and the alternate Z line that I have commented out in each of the notebooks


For example, for Python 3 users:
import zipfile, requests, io
r = requests.get('https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201409-citibike-tripdata.zip')
z = zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(r.content))
df = pd.read_csv(z.open('201409-citibike-tripdata.csv'))

For Python 2 users:
import zipfile, requests, StringIO
r = requests.get('https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/201409-citibike-tripdata.zip')
z = zipfile.ZipFile(StringIO.StringIO(r.content))
df = pd.read_csv(z.open('201409-citibike-tripdata.csv'))

Packages used:


import math
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import scipy
import scipy.stats
import datetime as dt
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
import requests
import zipfile
import io
#if using python 2 to import the data, comment out io and uncomment the following lines:
#import StringIO
#from __future__ import print_function
