# Week 3 Homework


This folder contains the homework for week 3 of PUI.  It consists of 2 parts.

In the first part we created 100 different runs of 6 different distributions of varying sizes between (10,2000).  We then graphed their individual means, and the overall distribution means.  This exercise was to reinforce the idea of the Central Limit Theorom -- that with increased sample size most distributions are approimately normal.

The second part of the homework was an exercise about Z-scores and Chi-Squared Tests.
