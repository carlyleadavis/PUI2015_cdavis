# Manushi Plot Review

![Alt text](PUI_HW8Manushi.png)

Manushi's Graphs is graphically clear and easy to read.  The titles were an appropriate size, and the color scheme was great.  It would be more useful to have a more verbose title, and a more succinct legend (perhaps move the explicit radius distance into the figure title), but graphically it was very straightforward what she was trying to represent, and I ingested the information quickly and efficiently.
